# Exercise 03

In this exercise you'll enhance the basic CAP project by adding to the data model and service definition, and creating a persistence layer.

##Â Covering (partially from [notes](../orgdocs/notes.md))

- Adding a new Authors entity definition
- Looking at relationships between Authors and Books and how we describe them in CDS
- Establishing a persistence layer (cds deploy)
- Understanding what's going on underneath (cds compile)
- Seeding the persistence layer and service with data via CSV
- Introducing more entities and building relationships between them (Associations / Compositions)
- Trying out OData operations (CRUD+Q) on the basic service

## Questions

Why does placing CSV files in a certain place just work? (convention ove configuration philosophy)
What happens to the content of `package.json` after a deploy?
What are some of the differences between OData V2 and V4 with respect to query options?
