# Exercise 08 - Introducing an app at the UI layer

In this exercise you'll add a UI layer, by adding annotations that can drive aspects of a user interface (UI), and introducing a Fiori Elements based app.


## Steps

Following these steps, you'll build a simple Fiori app that sits in a local Fiori launchpad environment, and that serves up book details from the `CatalogService` OData service, helped by annotations that you'll be specifying.


### 1. Introduce a sandbox launchpad for the UI

Following the "convention over configuation" theme, the Node.js flavored CAP will also automatically serve static resources (such as UI artefacts) from a directory called `app/`. If there isn't an `app/` directory it will serve the "Welcome to cds.services" landing page we've seen already:

![the "Welcome to cds.services" landing page](../07/two-services.png)

If there is an `app/` directory with content, it will serve that instead.

:point_right: Create an `app/` directory, at the same level as the `db/` and `srv` directories, and create an `index.html` file within it, containing the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>

	<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
	<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8" />
	<title>Bookshop</title>


</head>
<body class="sapUiBody" id="content"></body>
</html>
```
