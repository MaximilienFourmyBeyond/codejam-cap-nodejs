# Exercise 05

In this exercise you'll enhance the service definition with annotations, and introduce a second service that sits on top of the same underlying data model.

##Â Covering (partially from [notes](../orgdocs/notes.md))

- Basic annotations (@readonly, @insertonly) in the service
- Introducing a second service on the same data model (admin related)

## Questions

What are the advantages to separating the data model and service layers? Are there any disadvantages?
