# Exercise 04

In this exercise you'll add a further entity to the data model and expose it through the service. In defining this entity you'll make use of some common definition features available to all CAP projects.

##Â Covering (partially from [notes](../orgdocs/notes.md))

- Loading a set of queries into Postman (via URL)
- Adding a third entity Orders
- Using features in common.cds (Countries, Currencies, managed, cuid, etc) to describe the Orders entity
- Trying OData create operations with a UUID based key field on an entity, with and without supplying a UUID

## Questions

What else is in `common.cds` and in what circumstances might it be useful?
Are there any issues with the way we have set up the service definition right now?
