# Exercise 02

In this exercise you'll become familiar with the workflow of creating a new CAP project from the command line, and discover how quickly you can get to a basic OData service serving a simple metadata document.

##Â Covering (partially from [notes](../orgdocs/notes.md))

- Looking at different options of `cds init`
- Difference between db and srv (data model and service)
- Getting a basic OData service (at least the metadata) up quickly, without even any persistence layer (`cds run`) (basic = a single entity, no relationships or anything, probably based on the sample Books from `cds init`)
- Small excursion into OData, showing service document, metadata document, and data resources
- Exploring what we have in the basic project (folders, files)

## Questions

Why is there an focus on "TTM" (time to metadata) - what advantages does that bring?
What is the difference between the data model and the service definition? Why do we need both?
