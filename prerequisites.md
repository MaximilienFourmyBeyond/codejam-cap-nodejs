Each participant should have their own laptop with enough admin privileges to be able to install software. You should also be able to access a command line shell (e.g. `cmd.exe` on Windows). The laptop should also be able to connect to the host organization's guest network for Internet access, and have enough power for the whole day.

## Software

Before the CodeJam day, participants should ensure they have the following installed on their laptops:

- Chrome (latest version) : [https://www.google.com/chrome/](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- Visual Studio Code : [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Node : [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- SQLite : [https://sqlite.org/index.html](https://sqlite.org/index.html)
- git : [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
- Postman : [https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/)
- The Cloud Foundry command line tool cf : [https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html)

With regards to Node, we recommend the latest LTS (long term support) version. After installation, please check that you can start node from the command line, and also successfully install packages with the included `npm` command.

## Attendees

Some familiarity with JavaScript is strongly recommended. Existing familiarity with Core Data Services (CDS) concepts is an advantage, as is experience with working with command line tools.

Each attendee should have an SAP Cloud Platform trial account, and specifically a Cloud Foundry environment with an organization and a space defined. See the [Getting started with Cloud Foundry](https://developers.sap.com/uk/tutorials/hcp-cf-getting-started.html) tutorial for more details.

Attendees wishing to prepare themselves for the day can take advantage of the tutorial [Create a Basic Node.js App](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-node-create-basic-app.html) in the SAP Developer Center.
